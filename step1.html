                <h2>The Best Shoulder Workout Routine</h2>
                <ul>
                       <li>Barbell Overhead Press: 3 sets of 4 to 6 reps</li>
                       <li>Seated Dumbbell Overhead Press: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps</li>
                       <li>Dumbbell Side Lateral Raise: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps</li>
                       <li>Dumbbell Rear Lateral Raise: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps</li>

                <h2>How do you avoid injuring your shoulders?</h2>
                <p>Many people would have you believe the shoulders are weak, fragile joints that need to be babied, and that the slightest deviation from perfect form in the gym is likely to end in injury.This isn’t true.Shoulders are very tough and respond well to heavy weightlifting, but using incorrect form over time can irritate them (which is also true of any other joint). 
                </p>

                <p> Thus, always make sure you use proper form and gradually increase the weights over time as you get stronger. And if a particular exercise still irritates your shoulders even when using proper form, swap it out for another one..</p>

            </div>
            <div class="section" >
                <h2>How often should I train my shoulders?</h2>
                <p>People who’ve been following a proper strength training program for less than two years should aim for 10 to 15 sets per week, and those who’ve been training properly for more than two years should aim for 15 to 20 sets per week.</p>

                <p>You can try to fit all of these sets into one workout, but you’ll probably find that the quality of your sets begins to suffer as you get deeper into a long training session.
                That’s why it’s better to divide your sets over two or even three workouts. .</p>

                <h2>Dumbbell lateral raise</h2>
                <ul>
                       <li>Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and your arms at your side, holding a dumbbell in each hand.</li>
                       <li>Raise your arms to your sides until they’re level with your shoulders. Keep your palms facing downward.</li>
                       <li>Slowly lower your arms, and repeat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Benefits: This move is an excellent way to target your middle deltoid, Kelley says..</p>

                <h2>Dumbbell Reverse fly</h2>
                <ul>
                       <li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand.</li>
                       <li>Bend forward at the hips until your chest is almost parallel with the ground. Allow the weights to hang straight down at arm’s length, palms facing each other. This is the starting position.</li>
                       <li>Keeping your back flat, raise your arms out to your sides until they’re in line with your body. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Benefits: Although primarily an upper back exercise, this move also engages the posterior deltoid, says Kelly.</p>
