                <h2>The Best Abdomen Workout: The Only 4 Exercises You Need to Get a Six-Pack</h2>
                <ul>
                       <li>Hardstyle plank. Equipment: None</li>
                       <li>Dead bug. Equipment: None</li>
                       <li>Barbell back squat</li>
                       <li>Bird dog. Equipment: None</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Hardstyle plank. Equipment: None</h2>
                <p>Do it: Lying face down on the ground, prop yourself up into a forearm plank position. Make sure your elbows are aligned underneath your shoulders, and that your hands are balled up in fists. Your forearms should be parallel to one another. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds per set.</p>

                <p>Trainer tip: You know planks, right? It’s easy to go through the motions here. Don’t do it. “The key is to squeeze your entire body—quads, glutes, core, back, and fists—as tight as possible while taking diaphoretic breathes throughout the hold,” says Wealth. No matter how many times you’ve done it, this exercise is as difficult as you’re willing to make it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" >
                <h2>Dead bug. Equipment: None</h2>
                <p>Do it: Lay face up on the floor with arms straight above your shoulders. To start, bring your knees directly over your hips and bend at the knee so that your calf forms a 90-degree angle with your thigh. Next, simultaneously lower your left arm above your head while straightening your right leg and sending it towards the floor. Pause, return to the starting position, and then repeat on the opposite side. Do 14 alternating reps to complete one set.</p>

                <p>Trainer tip: “Make sure your lower back stays in contact with the floor, and try to keep your breathing as regular as possible,” says Denzel Allen, a StrongFirst trainer in San Francisco. “I like this movement because it helps to train left-right coordination between the upper and lower extremities, which can help improve cognitive function, too.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" >
                <h2>Barbell back squat</h2>
                <p>Do it: With your feet shoulder-width apart, lift a barbell off the rig, centering it evenly across your shoulders. (This version of the squat targets the core, not the legs, and so you should be using far less weight than you would for a traditional back squat.) Send your glutes back like you’re lowering into a chair, bending at the knees as deeply as possible. Press through your heels to return to the starting position for one rep. Do 12 reps for one set.</p>

                <p>Trainer tip: “Think about maintaining tension in your abs throughout the entire movement,” says Wealth. “Once you have the movement mastered, you can add additional weights to the barbell. By going up in small increments, though, you’ll stay injury-free.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" >
                <h2>Bird dog. Equipment: None</h2>
                <p>Do it: Think of this as an upside-down dead bug. Start in a tabletop position, with your shoulders over wrists and hips over knees. Engage your core while simultaneously lifting your right arm and left leg. Your foot should be flexed as you kick back, and your palm should face in towards your body. Pause for one second when your arm and leg are at the same height as your torso, and then bring your elbow and knee to touch underneath the body. Repeat on the other side for one rep, and do five reps for one set.</p>

                <p>Trainer tip: “Be careful not to hyperextend your elbows! Maintaining a slight bend fires up those triceps,” says Wilking. “Keep the neck long by looking down and a few inches in front of you, and use the exhale portion of each breath to create tension.”</p>
