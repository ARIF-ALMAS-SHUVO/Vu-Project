                <h2>The Importance of Exercise</h2>
                <p>We all know that exercise is important in our daily lives, but we may not know why or what exercise can do for us.
                   It’s important to remember that we have evolved from nomadic ancestors who spent all their time moving around in search of food and shelter, travelling large distances on a daily basis. Our bodies are designed and have evolved to be regularly active.</p>

                <h2>The Benefits of Exercise</h2>
                <ul>
                       <li>Exercise increases energy levels</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Exercise improves both the strength and the efficiency of your cardiovascular system to get the oxygen and nutrients to your muscles.  When your cardiovascular system works better everything seems easier and you have more energy for the fun stuff in life.</p>
                <ul>
                       <li>Exercise improves muscle strength</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Staying active keeps muscles strong and joints, tendons and ligaments flexible, allowing you to move more easily and avoid injury. Strong muscles and ligaments reduce your risk of joint and lower back pain by keeping joints in proper alignment. They also improve coordination and balance.</p>
                <ul>
                       <li>Exercise can help you to maintain a healthy weight</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The more you exercise, the more calories you burn.  In addition, the more muscle you develop, the higher your metabolic rate becomes, so you burn more calories even when you’re not exercising.  The result?  You may lose weight and look better physically which will boost your self-esteem.</p>
                <ul>
                       <li>Exercise improves brain function</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Exercise increases blood flow and oxygen levels in the brain. It also encourages the release of the brain chemicals (hormones) that are responsible for the production of cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that controls memory and learning.  This, in turn, boosts concentration levels and cognitive ability, and helps reduce the risk of cognitive degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>

                <h2>The Importance of Diet and Exercise</h2>
                <p>Diet: Dietary needs differ for every person, but in general, some of the best foods you should regularly eat include</p>
                <ul>
                       <li>Fruits and vegetables</li>
                       <li>Protein</li>
                       <li>Whole grains</li>
                       <li>Nuts and legumes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Try to balance items like dairy and oils, along with meats and poultry. Try to avoid sweets, overly salty foods, trans fat-heavy foods and overuse of alcohol. Pay attention to calorie count—your needed amount will vary based on your size, age and gender.</p>
